# Interfaces: From Protocols to ABCs

## Interfaces and Protocols
- Interface: the collection of methods and attributes that a class or module exposes for use by the rest of the program
- Statically typed languages like Java define formal interfaces. The code will not compile if a class does not implement
every method defined in its interface.
- Dynamically typed languages like Python, Ruby, and Javascript use Protocols, which are informal interfaces not 
enforced by the language, but followed by programmers as a best practice.

## Python Data model tries to abide by protocols
- Ex: Sequence Protocol
- Abstract base class for a sequence:
    - has an abstract `__getitem__` method
    - implements concrete `__contains__`, `__iter__` and `__reversed__` methods
- If a programmer implements their own sequence like object with only a `__getitem__` method, there are default implementations of the other 3 methods. 

## Monkey Patching Example
- *Monkey Patching* - changing a class or module at runtime, without modifying the source code.
- French Deck example:
    - `FrenchDeck` class did not implement a shuffle method
    - Author monkey patches the `__setitem__` method by making a direct assignment
        ```python
        FrenchDeck.__setitem__ = set_card
        ```
    - `__setitem__` is part of the mutable sequence protocol.
    - The `random.shuffle` method works on mutable sequences, so it can now be called on `FrenchDeck` instances.
- **Warning**: Monkey Patched code is tightly coupled.

## Alex Martelli Guest Essay on ABCs
- Duck typing requires avoiding use of isinstance to check types.
- Allows for more flexible programs.
- Shortcoming of duck typing: unrelated objects may share a method name that behaves differently in each context.
- Ex:
    ```python
        Class Artist:
            def draw(self): ...

        Class Gunslinger:
            def draw(self): ...
    ```
- *Goose typing* - account for context by using abstract base classes
    - okay to use isinstance, provided it is only used on ABCs.
- suggests not implementing custom ABCs, but making use of the ABCs that classes implicitly inherit from through protocols

## Key Takeaways
- Following established protocols improves the chances of reusing standard library and third party code.
