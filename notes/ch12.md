# Chapter 12 - Inheritance: For Good or Worse
Topics:
- Pitfalls of subclassing built in types
- Multiple inheritance and method resolution order
## Subclassing built in types
- Subclasses of built in types do not abide by object-oriented principles
- Example: subclassing `dict` and overriding the `__setitem__` method does not change the behavior of the `update` method, because they have different internal C implementations.
- This is a performance tradeoff.
- Safe method: instead of subclassing built in types directley, subclass from [`collections.UserDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.UserDict), [`collections.UserList`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#userlist-objects), and [`collections.UserStr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#userstring-objects)
## Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order
- Multiple Inheritance's "diamond problem": a choice needs to be made to resolve method calls when multiple superclasses have methods with the same name.
- Precedence of calls to direct superclasses is resolved left to right using the order from the class definition
    - Ex:
    ```python
    class K(X,Y):
        def do_something(self):
            super().do_something()
            # do something else
    ```
    - super().do_something() resolved to `X.do_something` before `Y.do_something`
- Can call `K.__mro__` in a terminal to check the *method resolution order* of a class
    - MRO from python 2.3 is computed using the C3 algorithm described [in this article](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/)
        - not sure if the algorithm has changed since then ... investigate
- It is always possible to call an instance method on a superclass, provided, the instance calling the method is explicitly passed as a parameter.
    - Ex: `Y.do_something(self)`
## Multiple Inheritance in Practice
- Tips for keeping multiple inheritance hierarchies clean and easy to follow:
    1. Distinguish interface inheritance from implementation inheritance
        - **interface inheritance**: subclassing to create a subtype
        - **implementation inheritance**: subclassing to reuse code
        - implementation inheritance can be replaced by composition and delegation
    1. Use ABCs to define interfaces
    1. Use mixin classes for code reuse
        - **mixin**: class that bundles methods for reuse
        - mixins should never be directly instantiated
        - concrete classes should not inherit only from a mixin
        - mixin classes should have a `Mixin` suffix in their name
    1. Don't subclass from more than one concrete class
        - **concrete class**: class that is instantiated
    1. Provide Aggregate classes to users
        - **aggregate class**: class that bundles together functionality of several mixins and ABCs
        - ex: [Django ListView](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/generic/list.py#L194)'s class body consists only of a docstring. All of its functionality is inherited from mixins
        ```python
        class ListView(MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin, BaseListView):
        """
        Render some list of objects, set by `self.model` or `self.queryset`.
        `self.queryset` can actually be any iterable of items, not just a queryset.
        """
        ```
    1. Favor composition over inheritance
        - From GoF design patterns book
        - **composition**: "has a" relationship
            - basis for dependency injection
        - **inheritance**: "is a" relationship
## Soapbox
- Application programmers usually do not need to implement class hierarchies. Libraries and frameworks exist to eliminate that duplication of labor.
- Multiple inheritance in other languages
    - C++: supports multiple inheritance
    - Java: does not support multiple inheritance. Interfaces behave similarly to ABCs, except they cannot store state
    - Scala, PHP, and Groovy use *traits*
        - **traits**: constrained mixins
    - Ruby: include mixins as a language feature
        - classes can include modules in their body, and the module's methods become part of the class implementation
    - Go: no inheritance. Interfaces are implemented as a static form of duck-typing.
    - Julia: has typing system, but subtypes only inherit behaviors, and not structure
