# Chapter 12 - Inheritance: For Good or Worse
Topics:
- Pitfalls of subclassing built in types
- Multiple inheritance and method resolution order
## Subclassing built in types
- Subclasses of built in types do not abide by object-oriented principles
- Example: subclassing `dict` and overriding the `__setitem__` method does not change the behavior of the `update` method, because they have different internal C implementations.
- This is a performance tradeoff.
- Safe method: instead of subclassing built in types directley, subclass from [`collections.UserDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.UserDict), [`collections.UserList`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#userlist-objects), and [`collections.UserStr`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#userstring-objects)
## Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order
- Multiple Inheritance's "diamond problem": a choice needs to be made to resolve method calls when multiple superclasses have methods with the same name.
- Precedence of calls to direct superclasses is resolved left to right using the order from the class definition
    - Ex:
    ```python
    class K(X,Y):
        def do_something(self):
            super().do_something()
            # do something else
    ```
    - super().do_something() resolved to `X.do_something` before `Y.do_something`
- Can call `K.__mro__` in a terminal to check the *method resolution order* of a class
    - MRO from python 2.3 is computed using the C3 algorithm described [in this article](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/)
        - not sure if the algorithm has changed since then ... investigate
- It is always possible to call an instance method on a superclass, provided, the instance calling the method is explicitly passed as a parameter.
    - Ex: `Y.do_something(self)`
